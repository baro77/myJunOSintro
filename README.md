# myJunosIntro
Some very short notes (11 pages overall) I have written during early '18 to share with my colleagues a common, entry-level Junos CLI knowledge baseline, to evaluate Juniper devices with regard to some future procurements.

Just the very minimum needed to play by yourself with that environment, IMHO.

Screenshots come from a vMX appliance running on GNS3; copyright for the configurations infographic goes to "JUNIPER NETWORKS Junos Fundamentals Series JUNIPER DAY ONE: EXPLORING THE JUNOS CLI".
